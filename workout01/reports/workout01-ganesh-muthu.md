Introduction

For the past five years, the Golden State Warriors have redefined what it means to be a sports dynasty. Since 2015, the Warriors have won three NBA Championships and four division titles. Few franchises have ever accomplished such a feat, and in modern history the only organization that rivals the Warriors success - the New England Patriots - play in the National Football League.

When people view the Warriors success, a few things, such as coaching and management, quickly come to mind. However, nothing is more telling of the Warrior’s success than how effectively they shoot the basketball. Whether the shot is worth two points or three points, the Warriors have players that can effectively shoot all types of baskets. This report seeks the analyze the two point, three point, and overall effective shooting percentages of the Warriors starting lineup: small forward Andre Iguodala, power forward Draymond Green, small forward Kevin Durant, shooting guard Klay Thompson, and point guard Stephen Curry. Additionally, this report seeks to visually analyze where and how effectively these five Warriors shoot from different parts of the court. The following analysis was completed with NBA data from the 2016-2017 NBA season.

Effective 2PT Shooting Percentage
---------------------------------

First, let’s analyze the effective two point shooting percentages of Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry.

As you can see, Andre Iguodala is the most effective two point shooter of the five players with a percentage made of 63.80%. He is closely followed by Kevin Durant at 60.65%. After Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry made 53.99%, Klay Thompson made 51.41%, and Draymond Green made 49.42%.

We can equate Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant’s high effective two point shooting percentages to their height and positions. Andre Iguodala is currently listed at six foot six inches, while Kevin Durant is listed at six foot nine inches. Both of these players also spend a lot of time inside the three point arc, which results in a lot of two point shots. Interesting, Andre Iguodala actually attempted the least number of two points shots of the five players measured. However, he is extremely accurate: of the 210 shots attempted, Iguodala made 134. In contrast, Kevin Durant attempted a five-player high of 643 shots, and made 390. So although Durant and Iguodala have similar effective percentages, Durant scores many more points.

Effective 3PT Shooting Percentage
---------------------------------

Next, let’s analyze the effective three point shooting percentages of Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry.

As you can see, Klay Thompson is actually the most effective three point shooter of the five players measured with an effective three point percentage of 42.41. He is closely followed by Stephen Curry at 40.75%. Then, Kevin Durant shoots 38.60%, Andre Iguodala shoots 36.02%, and Draymond Green shoots 31.89%.

Although many people think Stephen Curry is the best three point shooter on the Warriors, the data says otherwise. Curry did make more three point shots than Thompson; however, he attempted significantly more. Curry made 280 three pointers on 687 attempts, while Thompson made 246 three pointers on 580 attempts. That is more than 100 less attempts to make just 34 less three pointers.

Effective Shooting Percentage
-----------------------------

Thirdly, let’s analyze the overall effective shooting percentages of Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry.

![](workout01-ganesh-muthu_files/figure-markdown_github/chart3-1.png)

Although Kevin Durant was neither the best three point shooter nor the best two point shooter, he is actually the best overall shooter of the five players measured. Durant makes an excellent 54.09% of his shots, while Andre Iguodala is second at 51.75% of shots made. Klay Thompson at 47.13%, Stephen Curry at 46.72%, and Draymond Green at 42.38% complete analysis.

This chart makes clear that Kevin Durant is an astonishing accurate shooter. Although Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson make a lot of headlines for putting up a lot of points, they also attempt a lot more overall shots than Durant. Durant only attempted 915 shots to make 495, while Thompson and Curry attempted 1220 and 1250 to make 575 and 584, respectively. This analysis also makes clear that a player like Andre Iguodala, who is not necessarily known for putting up a lot of points, makes his attempts on the basket count. Although he attempted only 371 shots, a fraction of what players like Curry, Thompson, and Durant attempted, he made 192 of them to give him the second best effective shooting percentage of the five players. Finally, this analysis makes clear that Draymond Green is by far the worst shooter of the five. He finished last in two point effective shooting percentage, three point effective shooting percentage, and overall effective shooting percentage.

Player Shot Charts
------------------

Finally, let’s take a look at the shot charts for Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry.

Starting with Iguodala, we can see that he takes significantly less shots than the other four players. There is a decent number of shots clustered at the basket, which complements his high effective two point shooting percentage.

Next, we can see that Draymond Green is not an effective shooter. He by far has the most missed shots, both near the basket and along the three point arc. This also highlights that when Green takes a three point shot, he is likely to take it from the top of the arc.

Third, Kevin Durant’s shot chart highlights how effective he is from anywhere on the court. Both along the arc and inside the paint, Durant makes shots. The high density of green representing made shots complements his place as the most effective shooter of the five.

Penultimately, Klay Thompson’s shot chart has a high percentage of shots along the three point line. This makes clear that Thompson likes to take three pointers, and a significant number of green dots along the arc support the fact that he is the Warriors most effective three point shooter.

Finally, Stephen Curry’s shot chart resembles Klay Thompson’s. One important distinction is that Curry tends to take deeper three pointers than Thompson does. Many of his three point attempts take place well beyond the arc, which shows Curry’s deep threat and accuracy. There also seems to be a cluster of shots on court left near the three point arc, which suggests Curry prefers to shoot from that side of the basket.

Conclusion
----------

The Warriors are an incredibly diverse team with a starting lineup that compliments each other immensely. Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant are excellent two point shooters, while Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry are great three point shooters. Kevin Durant is also the most effective shooter on the team, and combined with his athleticism and size make him an incredibly potent player. The shot charts also complement this data visually. Combined with the outstanding management and coaching of the Warriors organization, it’s no surprise that the Golden State Warriors are the best team in NBA and the current team to beat for an NBA championship.
