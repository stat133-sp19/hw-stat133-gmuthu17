Description:

This homework involves analyzing shot data from the 2016 NBA season for
five Golden State Warriors players: Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green,
Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry. With .csv files obtained
from the class github, a single dataframe containg all necessary data
for shot charts and analysis was created. Five individual shot charts
for each player was then created, and subsequent analysis was completed
to determine the most effective two point shooter, three point shooter,
and overall shooter of the five. Finally, a comprehensive report was
created in an .rmd file to portray the results and graphics created in
the homework.
