knitr::include_graphics("../../Stat133/Channa.png")
```

### Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 2 medium onions, minced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
* 1 fresh, hot green chili pepper, minced
* 1 tablespoon ground coriander
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and ground
* 1 tablespoon amchoor powder
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 2 cups tomatoes, chopped small
* 2/3 cup water
* 4 cups cooked chickpeas
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 lemon (juiced)

### Directions

Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion, garlic, ginger and pepper and saut√© over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn heat down to medium-low and add the coriander, cumin, cayenne, turmeric, cumin seeds, amchoor (if using it), paprika and garam masala. Cook onion mixture with spiced for a minute or two, then add the tomatoes and any accumulated juices, scraping up any bits that have stuck to the pan. Add the water and chickpeas. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, then stir in salt and lemon juice.

### Notes
Excellent in the winter!

# Euclidean Distance
### Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = ($p_1$, $p_2$,..., $p_n$) and **q** = ($q_1$, $q_2$,..., $q_n$) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

*d*(**p**, **q**) = *d*(**q**, **p**) = $\sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + ... + (q_n - p_n)^2}$  =  $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i - p_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$||\textbf p|| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 +...+ p_n^2} = \sqrt{\textbf p \cdot \textbf p}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
